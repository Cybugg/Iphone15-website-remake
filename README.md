### iPhone 15 Website Clone

This project is a clone of the official iPhone 15 website. It aims to replicate the design, layout, and functionality of the original site using modern web technologies. The purpose of this project is to practice and showcase web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, GSAP, ThreeJS and responsive design techniques.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Accurate replication of the iPhone 15's sleek and modern user interface.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes interactive features such as image sliders, animations, and navigation menus.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind to ensure a seamless experience for all users.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for fast loading times and smooth performance.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure and content of the site.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- **TailwindCSS**: To help with responsive design and layout.
- **NEXTJS**: A React framework for faster production.
- **ThreeJS**:To render 3D components on the website
- **GSAP**:To make complex animations easier to accomplish faster on the website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
